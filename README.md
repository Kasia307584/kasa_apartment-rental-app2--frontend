# Kasa - Apartment Rental App

Kasa is an apartment rental platform that allows users to browse and explore available apartment listings. Each apartment listing includes detailed descriptions and photo galleries, offering a clear view of the properties. The app features smooth and intuitive navigation, a responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes, and error handling for invalid URLs.

Backend setup with Apollo: [Kasa - backend](https://github.com/Kasia307584/kasa_apartment-rental-app2--backend).

_Work in progress:_

- This app is an upgrade of this [Kasa project](https://github.com/Kasia307584/kasa_apartment-rental-app--frontend), incorporating TypeScript and GraphQL.
- The styles implementation needs to be finalized for this project.
- See the live version of the basic project [here](https://kasa-app-five.vercel.app/).

## My process

### Built with

- **React.js** for building the user interface
- **React Router** for managing navigation and routing between pages
- **TypeScript** for type safety and improved developer experience
- **GraphQL** for efficient data fetching and API communication
- **Apollo Client** for managing GraphQL queries and caching
- **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds

### What I learned

- Setting up a React project with TypeScript's configuration
- Using TypeScript in a React project and how it replaces React's prop types checking for component parameters
- Setting up GraphQL with Apollo Client
- Writing and executing GraphQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data

### Continued development

- add styles in Sass
- make the page responsive
